Use the given scenario description to create a list of three people, two tasks, and two skills.  Each skill should be associated with one of the tasks, and it should be that each skill is unique and orthogonal to the other and it's assigned task.

Rules
 1) Never indicate in someones name their title or that they are good at any particular skill or task.  For example, never say "Dr. Bob" as this implies they should be in charge of medical tasks.

Here's an example

Description: A heavy flux of customers walk into the coffee bar, you have to assign workers to the register and others to be baristas to handle the flow.

Output:

People: Sarah; Luis; John;
Tasks: Barista; Cashier
Skills: Can make coffee; Can handle customers

You will write a short story given the description of a scenario and a list of facts. You must include every fact into the story.  

You should take the role of a manager or leader, someone who can assign people to skills.  

Your job is to find the perfect assignment of each person to a single skill.  You will not say what this perfect assignment is, that is left to the reader to decide.  

Instead, you must write out the narrative as if it were a short story. Make this story coherent and flow nicely.  

Most importantly, make this story interesting! 

Start with an introduction.  
Introduce each person:
- {people[0]}
- {people[1]}
- {people[2]}

And the tasks the manager has to assign them to (mention these by name in the beginning, i.e. "And they all had to be assigned to cleaning and sales" or something.):
- {tasks[0]}
- {tasks[1]}

Facts that you must include in your story:

I want you to rewrite the introduction paragraph to introduce each person and the tasks.  Do not assign people to a task (this is the question I want to ask the readers), just introduce them.  Rewrite the introduction:

{paragraphs[0]}

Make sure it includes:

Mentions to these peoples names (do not describe them)
- {people[0]}
- {people[1]}
- {people[2]}

And the tasks the manager has to assign them to (mention these by name in the beginning, i.e. "And they all had to be assigned to cleaning and sales" or something.)
- {tasks[0]}
- {tasks[1]}

It should be short.  No longer than the original introduction.
