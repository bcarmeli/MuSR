Your task is to generate a logic tree for a story, as shown in the example. In this tree, each fact should be deduced from its immediate children. If a deduced fact already has a name, do not overwrite it.

Type of story:

We are creating a murder mystery. A murder mystery needs to have a complex web of evidence that leads to a means, motive, and opportunity for a suspect, which will make them a likely murderer. When writing a murder mystery, the story should take the point of view of the detective.  Evidence should be collected through investigation, including things like interrogation, hearing conversations, reading past criminal records, looking at mail or trash, and other normal modes of detecting evidence.

1. Each fact in the tree must follow via logical deduction from its children.
2. All Fact From Story nodes and the Commonsense Knowledge node must be relevant to the deduction they yield.
3. Each root fact is labeled with a source (Fact from Story or Commonsense Knowledge).
4. A Fact From Story should be a statement about a character, place, or object in the story.
5. Commonsense Knowledge should be a fact that most people will know and agree with. It should not explicitly reference any characters in the story.
6. Commonsense Knowledge should be used as a deduction rule that when the sibling facts are applied to it they yield the parent deduced fact.
7. The tree you generate must match the structure of the tree I give you.

A suspect has a means when they have access to the murder weapon.
A suspect has a motive when the suspect has reason to kill the victim.
A suspect has an opportunity when they were at the crime scene.

You must adhere to the parent nodes facts even if they are outlandish or fantastical.

We are creating a murder mystery. A murder mystery needs to have a complex web of evidence for a suspect. When writing a murder mystery, the story should take the point of view of the detective.  Evidence should be collected through investigation, including things like interrogation, hearing conversations, reading past criminal records, looking at mail or trash, and other normal modes of detecting evidence.

We will give you a list of facts to use when writing your story.  You must include all the facts in the list. Never state deduced facts or conclusions. The story should stick to the fact list pretty closely.

You will write a chapter for the murder mystery. This should not introduce the murder or victim, but strictly follow a detective slowly interviewing and detecting the suspect.  Use the list below as a guide.  

Rules:
1. Only write the contents of the chapter, do not write a title or number it.  This text must be easily placed in a larger story.
2. Never say a suspect has a means
3. Never say a suspect has a motive
4. Never say a suspect has an opportunity
5. Never hint at a suspect having or not having a means, motive, or opportunity. 3. Never hint at or explicitly say a deduced fact.
6. Never say a suspect is a murderer.  It's a puzzle that the reader is supposed to guess and deduce!
7. Write the story from the perspective of a detective uncovering clues through various methods that normal detectives use (interrogation, notes, stake-outs, etc.)
8. Never make mental notes, point out suspicious facts, nor make connections.  Let the reader do this.

Include as many sentences as needed to write each fact from the list of facts.  Also include up to 10 sentences of dialogue.

Here is an example:

Suspect and crime information
Victim: Dora
Crime Scene: Remote forest
Murder Weapon: Knife
Suspect: Willard
Role in story: Grounds keeper
The suspect's motive: Religious sacrifice

You are detective Winston.
Facts you must include:
- A witness saw someone with a spaghetti face and green ears
- Willard is a groundskeeper for a local school
- Willard also provides services to nearby residents like house painting, lawn care, etc.
- Willard painted a nearby home green.
- Willard was in a horrible fire when he was a child.
- Willard's family has been in the local area for multiple generations
- Long ago, the local area had religious extremists around them, all participating in occult activities.
- Willard and his immediate family were all handymen of some sort.
- Willard believes in respecting his elders and ancestral history.
- Dora had written about joining a new church nearby.
- A friend of Dora mentioned worrying about Dora's involvement with a new cult-like group of friends.

Output:

Winston took a long drag from his cigarette while reviewing the crime scene photos. He was hardened to common grotesqueries of his line of work, but the murder of Dora sparked something in him... a calling into the void.

The only hard evidence he had in this case was an eyewitness of a monster... a spaghetti face, green-eared monster. That, and the fact that Dora had been exploring some new church... or perhaps a cult, depending on who you asked. Cults had a history of leaving a bad taste in people's mouths here... having some very dark pasts in the local area.

Winston put his cigarette out, placed the photos down, and set out for his following suspect interview with Willard.

The smell of fresh-cut grass washed over Winston as the local groundskeeper of the local elementary shut off his mower.  

"Howdy, Mister," - Willard said with a rich southern twang.

"Howdy..." Winston said carefully, trying to match the southern pleasantries he wasn't all too familiar with.

"You, Willard?" Winston inquired.

"Well, sure I am!" He chuckled, "Been him for a while now, I suppose."  

"You do a lot of work for the school here?"  

"Heh, yes, sir, I do. My family and I have been helping out the local schools and locals with standard chores." noticing Winston motioning for him to continue, Willard explained further, "You know, like painting houses, cutting people's lawn... well heck, just a couple days ago I painted that green house over yonder." Willard said, pointing out across the schoolyard.

Winston couldn't help but notice that Willard had a severe burn scar across the bottom half of his face, which had previously been hidden by sweat and grass shavings.

*Ring* *Ring* - Winston was getting called away, back to the office, so he had to make a quick excuse to get away.

"You know the way back to Highway 45?" Winston asked. "Sure," Willard replied with a grin, "You take two lefts here, then about 12 miles down, you'll hit it." 

Winston smiled, "You sure do know your way around here," he said. "Hah, well, sir, my families have been here for... for a long, long time. I take great pride in my ancestry and family history here..."

With that, Winston got in his car and left.
